This browser game was created in the final project (Creative Code Lab) in my first semester studying creative Computing at the UAS St. PÃ¶lten. 
The project objective was to create a browser game in two weeks:
- Original Story
- Custom Assets
- Programming logic

## Story
After his parents died in a car accident, last Christmas, the eight-year-old Flynn now lives with his aunt and uncle. He loves them, but of course, misses his parents. He gets more and more introverted and does not want to go out or talk to anyone else. He lives in his own world. The real world starts to scare him more and more. His aunt does not know how to help him before his parentsâ€™ death he was completely different, always playing outside and making fun. She is overwhelmed with how to help him. When Flynn hears her and his uncle speaking, about sending him to a psychiatrist, he thinks that they want to send him away.

When it gets darker and it is time to go to bed, he plugs in his bee nightlight. While hugging his blankie and falling asleep he thinks about what his aunt said, and if he changed that much.
In the middle of the night, he wakes up and recognises something strange, the shadows are moving. The movement is caught by his nightlight Bixi, which is now flying through the room. Bixi tells him, that she is here to protect him and to help him overcome his fears. Bixi just points under his bed, where now is a portal, and tells him to go through that. Flynn does like said, although he does not know where his braveness comes from.

On the other side of the portal, he and Bixi are in a dark world populated by shadows. Now the adventure starts, and they must defeat his fears, and the shadows lingering on the way.
