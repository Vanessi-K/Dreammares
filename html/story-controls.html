                        After the fatal crash of his parents on Christmas Eve, the eight-year-old Flynn tends to get very anxious and distances himself from the world,
                        one night he hears his aunt worrying about his wellbeing. That night Flynn awakens from dozing and sees his nightlight,
                        but it has become alive, Bixi â€“ The bee-nightlight is hovering in his room and taking him on a journey to overcome his fears.
